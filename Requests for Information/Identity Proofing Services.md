# The Requirement

## The Purpose

GSA Technology Transformation Services provides best in class shared services to the government.  One such capability is around citizen-facing identity solutions.  This new capability will augment the existing identity solutions that TTS has today and potentially support new initiatives.  

The Identity Program Office is looking to acquire solutions that enable identity verification in-person. Additionally, the Identity Program Office is interested in optional remote/electronic identity verification services. These solutions must either be fully certified towards NIST SP 800-63-3 or provide the documentation to meet a subset of requirements for Identity Proofing.  

## Scope/Mission

The Program Office requires a vendor or service provider to provide identity verification for online services. We are aiming to improve our current total success rate while adhering to NIST standards.  The successful vendor should be able to fill in the gaps in performance by enabling in-person proofing or alternative remote methods to improve coverage.  

Our current remote proofing capability utilizes a web SDK to capture an applicant's government-issued photo ID and requests the user to take a headshot photo.  The system performs a match on those pictures and then requests the user to provide their date of birth, social security number and mobile number for verification.  This process meets the NIST SP 800-63-3 standard but does not pass all valid applicants.  

We are looking to supplement this existing process with additional capabilities with the goal of being able to identify the full American public to include in-person verification solutions as well as hybrid remote/video session capabilities.  

**Challenge:** Remote identity verification methods today cannot identity verify all potential applicants to the service.  

**Vision Statement:** TTS to enable a suite of identity verification methods that can fully meet the needs of the American Public

## Period and Place of Performance

This will be a software license or service without the need for a specific location. The anticipated period of performance is a 12-month base period and one (1) 12-month option, for a total for two (2) years. 

## Performance Objectives

The following are high-level objectives for this potential procurement. 

| Number | Objective | Sub Number | Key Result |
